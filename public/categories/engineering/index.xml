      <description>The advantages of Typescript over Javascript are obvious and little convincing is required to persuade a team to migrate from Javascript to Typescript. For historical reasons netlify/build was in Javascript and we decided to migrate it to Typescript in an effort to improve developer experience.&#xA;netlify/build is an opensource monorepo and receives frequent contributions. This constrained us from performing a big bang migration which has the risk of large merge conflicts.</description>
