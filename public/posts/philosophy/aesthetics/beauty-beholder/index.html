  <h1>Beauty Doesn&#39;t Lie In The Beholder&#39;s Eye</h1>
  <p>I want to explain why beauty is not in the eye of the beholder</p>
<p>What do I know about beauty?</p>
<ul>
<li>Aesthetic judgement is instinctive</li>
<li>Defined as something that pleases when seen</li>
<li>Beautiful objects have the following attributes
<ul>
<li>Orderliness</li>
<li>Harmony</li>
<li>Neatness</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>The cultural war has been fought on many fronts and beauty and art has not been left untouched. The essence of the war
is whether some values &ndash; moral or aesthetic &ndash; are objective or relative. I am convinced that relativism is an unstable
ground for any serious development because it first demands self deception, to accept as true that which is obviously
false. For example, if the relativist are right then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)">Duschamp&rsquo;s fountain</a>
is as beautiful as the Monalisa and if the objectivist are right, then indeed, beauty doesn&rsquo;t lie in the beholder&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>I have observed that aesthetic judgement is instictive and doesn&rsquo;t depend on intellect. We seem to understand at a
primordial level when something is beautiful or not. We might even have reasons as to why something is beautiful but
ironically we can&rsquo;t be convinced with reason that something is beautiful or not.</p>
<p>If I knew nothing about beauty and encountered the Monalisa for the first time, most certainly, I will be struck by the
level of detail captured in the painting. Looking at the painting keenly, I will notice the orderliness in its
proportions and the discipline in the brush strokes and out of awareness of my own artistic limitations I will be
compelled to appreciate the creator&rsquo;s mastery and craftmanship as if the purpose of the beautiful object is to point to
its creator.</p>
<p>Imagining myself as someone who didn&rsquo;t know what was beautiful, I will notice that they are things that are joyful
to look at and others that are not. But also, there are other things that are joyful to look at with my &ldquo;mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo;,
like a beautiful mathematical equation. I therefore conclude that there are two types of beautiful objects; concrete
objects, like a painting and abstract objects like ideas.</p>
<p>Beautiful objects that please to look at seem to have an orderliness about them with the parts existing in harmony and
in their rightful places. They also appear to be highly disciplined without any proportional indulgences. Their
realization is instictive and their appreciation doesn&rsquo;t not engage the mental faculties, we seem to know that something
is beautiful rather than think that it is beautiful.</p>
<p>As for the other type of beauty, some sophistication is required of the observer and it can even hide to the untrained
eye. For example, the beauty of a good novel is eternaly hidden to the illeterate and that of a beautiful mathematical
equation is infinitely covered to the mathematically disadvantaged. The primary attribute for this kind of beauty is two
folds; elegance of the object and developed taste of the subject.</p>
<p>However, both types of beauty call to mind their creator and demand appreciation for the craftmanship that went into
producing the beautiful object. From my experience, the pleasure that I get from looking at a beautiful artifact or that
from grasping a beautiful idea is the joy of understanding humanity&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
<p>To conclude, I have to give the unfortunate &ldquo;yes and no&rdquo; answer. The beauty of abstract objects like ideas does indeed
lie in the eye of the beholder and no for concrete objects.</p>
<p>Narrative</p>
<pre><code>I want to explore whether beauty truly lies in the eyes of the beholder

What is beauty?

    - Duschamp's fountain

    - Something that pleases when seen

    - Seen either by eyes or the mind's eye

        - Conceived &amp; Perceived

    - The judgement of beauty is instinctive, there are no reasons

    - Conclusion, in my consideration of beauty I did not think of the subject
