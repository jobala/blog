  <h1>Ideal Editor</h1>
  <p>I spend a lot of time editing text and I have used different text editors over the years. I started off on Sublime Text then I was introduced to Vim by a friend and it didn&rsquo;t quite stick then and it didn&rsquo;t help that I didn&rsquo;t know how to touch type. I spent time in the Jetbrain gulag even buying multiple licenses for different IDEs, then came VS Code and back to Vim. I primarily use Vim now because it&rsquo;s UI is minimal and helps me stay focused but I am not a Vim purist and there are things that I like from other editors I wish Vim had.</p>
<p>The reason why Vim makes it easy for me to stay focused is because of two things; minimal UI and modal editing. I find using vs code exhausting because of numerous widgets on the screen, pop ups and badges. With Vim, I can focus on the task at hand. The other reason is modal editing which reduces effort needed to try out different ideas whereas a mouse increases the drudgery.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, I am not a purist and frequently use vs code to &ldquo;debug in production&rdquo; because where Vim will require me to manually install language servers and dependencies VS Code&rsquo;s remote development feature just works. And because I don&rsquo;t use it for long during this time I don&rsquo;t mind the inconvenience. Vim emulation in VS Code is great but it doesn&rsquo;t feel the same which is why I keep going back to Vim.</p>
<p>I also think Sublime Text is a great editor with a beautiful UI, I haven&rsquo;t used it for more than a few consecutive days and my ignorance might show here but I find the lack of an integrated terminal limiting. My workflow involves building things in small iterations and as such I rely on the terminal to validate my assumptions and having to switch to a different window to do this is asking for too much. Also, I never seem able to get the language servers to work reliably.</p>
<p>With that said, my ideal editor would have Vim&rsquo;s modal editing as a native feature not an emulation and minimal ui, Sublime Text&rsquo;s beautiful UI and VS Code&rsquo;s extension marketplace and remote development feature. This editor doesn&rsquo;t exist and I might have to build it.</p>
