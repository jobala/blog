I have been working on [msgraph-cli](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-cli) for almost an year and during this period the project evolved from an experiment to a product. Its needs changed from proving that it works to communicating to stakeholders its state and managing issues, we adopted Scrum to address these needs. Please note that this is from small team perspective -- less than 5 people -- and might not work for you.


#### Sprint Planning
As we got closer to an alpha it became important to work on the right things and avoid being side tracked by non-essential issues. We use sprint planning for issue triaging and identifying the sprint's work items. This helps us keep our energy focused on a common goal and bring the CLI closer to the desired state with each sprint.


#### Sprint Review And Retrospective
We combined sprint review and retrospective into one meeting because of the size of our team. During this meeting we go through what we did and demo the changes. This solves the communication problem between engineering and other stakeholders.

We also reflect on the just concluded sprint and use the lessons to improve the next sprint.
