I left campus in my third year of studies to join Andela and even though I have learnt from many teachers the non-traditional self-study route is more commonly defined as self-taught. Having no guidance and feeling my way through I made a lot of mistakes and through trial and error maybe even pure luck I discovered things that work. This articles is about those things and the mistakes I made. 

The first I mistake I made was letting my work suffer because of some other thing I was learning. While working for FirstAccess, I remember taking a Coursera course on Machine learning and neglecting the obvious skill gaps that I had. My time would have been better spent learning more appropriate subjects.

The second mistake I made was being an haphazard seeker. I never quite saw things to their end and would quickly hope from technology to technology and when all was said and done I was like the seed that fell on a rocky ground, lacking deep routes. This was made worse by my impatience.

The third mistake I made was using the wrong resources for studying. There are books you can't stop reading and there are books you can't finish reading a page. Good books are worth their weight in Gold and I can't state enough how beneficial it is to use a good resource.


I have grown a lot since then. I understand that studying takes time so I usually read books over a long period of time without the pressure to complete it. I also have a study time and rarely study outside those hours. I also try and find the best material I can before starting the journey.

The tragedy of being self-taught is that you join people in the middle of a journey and there's no one to hold your hand.
