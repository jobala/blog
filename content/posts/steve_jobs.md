Intent
I want to write about how Steve Jobs simplicity principle and how I can apply it to improve the quality of my work.

Simplicity requires serious work

Narrative
- Core values that pervades everything you do
	- Best products for people to use
	- Not compromising on quality
		- Involve the decision maker

- Not stopping at the first solution
	- Reducing things to their essence
	- Simplicity stick
	- Ruthlessly enforce high standards

- Focus
	- Saying No to things you like
	- Making fewer, higher quality products. Do fewer things increadibly well.
	- Nothing more important than the work

- Attaining simplicity
	- It looks, acts and sound perfectly natural
	- It just works

What are you about?
Apple, people with passion can change the world


I love Apple products and my curiosity to understand the principles behind their ingenuity led me to read **Insanely Simple** by **Ken Segall** and to no surprise, behind the curtains Steve Jobs lies hidden. This article is a reflection of how Jobs, wielding Simplicity like a sword slayed the dragon of complexity, changing Apple's fate and fortunes. And much like St. George slayer of dragons, he becomes the patron saint of simplicity.

### Have Core Values

The first step towards simplicity is having core values that pervade everything you do. One of the things Steve was passionate about was building great products and it is not hard to argue that Apple devices are the best out there. Steve is famous for being relentless in his pursuit of the best not being satisfied with almost good. 

The common excuse for bypassing our values as software developers is that we need to beat the deadline, forgetting that the only way to go fast is to go well. We know the benefits of writing tests but many times we don't write them so as to meet a deadline.

### Don't Stop At The First Solution

Simplification is a reduction process. Many of us stop when we have a working solution but that is the point when we reduce things to their essence to get to the truly simple. We need to ruthlessly enforce high standards.

One of the things I am guilty of is stopping when it works. Code readability suffers the most. Once we have working a working solution that should be the starting point of finding a better solution and making the code more readable.

### Focus

Focus according to Steve Jobs is saying no to things that you would like to do and this shows in the range of products Apple has. While their competitors spread theirself too thin working on a wide range of products, Apple chose to do a few things well and it seems like it's working out well for them.

There's so much to learn and not enough time. We need to choose what we want to be good in and focus our energies on those things. Otherwise we will end up jacks of all trades and master of none.

### Conclusion
How do you know when you have achieved simplicity? When it looks, acts and sounds perfectly natural.
