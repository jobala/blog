Around three months ago I embarked on a journey through the **nand2Tetris** book to build a computer from scratch. This will be the third time I am attempting the journey after having lost interest midway twice. I decided to "physically" build the circuits so as to keep myself motivated. Seeing your creation coming to life has funny away of keeping you going. My goal was to understand the spirit of the device that I spend so much of my time on.

I used Circuitverse to build the circuits which you can see below. The effort was mostly successful and I ended up having a computer that can draw to a screen. I am fairly satisfied with how things turned out even though I couldn't load a program into the ROM because Circuitverse wouldn't let me. I was not planning on building the software stack but probably will do so at some point in the future.
