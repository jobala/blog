Intent
I want to write about why I want to build a raspberry pi cluster and building the cluster.

One of my new year resolutions for this year is to learn more about distributed systems and infrastructure and since I learn by doing, I decided to build a Raspberry Pi cluster which I will use for experiments. However, I learnt very soon that this will be a challenge because the Pis we sold out everywhere.
