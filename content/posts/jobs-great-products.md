[Insanely Simple](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insanely-Simple-Obsession-Drives-Success/dp/067092119X) opens the curtain on Apple's success and to no surprise reveals Steve Jobs as the mastermind behind Apples Products. The book had a lot to say about Jobs and on many occassions bordered on hero worship, this article is a reductionist view of Steve Jobs' principles and how we can adopt them as software engineers. 

### Minimalise

One of the things Steve Jobs did after returning to Apple was reduce the product offering to only a few devices. This was a common theme throughout the book and perhaps the fundamental principle. He always reduced product, process or options to the absolute essentials.

### Don't Compromise On Quality

Steve Jobs was relentless on his pursuit of quality and would pay attention to minute details. He once told engineer to redesign a computer board because it didn't look good.

As software engineers there is a temptation to make quick and dirty fixes for the sake of speed bypassing testing, refactoring and readability. We can borrow a leaf from Steve and make sure we put quality abover everything else.

### Be Involved In The Product

Steve understood something that most of us can't even begin to comprehend, the product is a lot more than the deliverable, it is also how it is marketed packaged and delivered and he was involved in all these stages of the product. There was nothing that was too small for him.

The lesson for software engineers is two fold here. First, we need to broaden our understanding of the product to include how the product is marketed and delivered to customers and second, adopt a collective ownership mindset so that we don't say person X is responsible for feature Y because we are all responsible.

Developers can be involved in marketing or advocacy by speaking at conferences, writing blogs and responding to StackOverflow questions.

### Focus On Your Core Competencies

When Steve returned to Apple he stopped a lot of the work that Apple was doing and focused on the Mac. Steve understood that for Apple to be successful it had to focus on what it does well, making computers. The focusing gave Apple the space to do a few things well.

Software engineers are susceptible to the shiny item syndrome, this is true especially for beginning software engineers. Instead of spreading yourself too thin, figure out a few things that you want to be competent in and zero in on them, then, as you progress in your career, progressively increase your circle of competence.

### Conclusion

We should aspire to build great products, the first solution is not always the best solution and focusing gives us more time to simplify and build high quality products.
