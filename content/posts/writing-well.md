I have been feasting on Gilbert Chesterton's writings for the last few days and I became more and more displeased at modern writing with every turning page. This is my rant 

It is disappointing that despite a more educated populace our contribution to the literary world is a careless expression of facts and a terribly bland text. Having read Chesterton's beautiful paragraphs, which are often full of well dressed sentences and delightful imagery, it makes me cringe everytime I hear the all too common "write like you speak" recommendation which leads to lacklustre writing.

The lack of inspiration in modern writing from time to time leaks onto the book's cover or an article's title, case in point, "The How Not to Give a Fuck" book. Where does one get the courage to put such obscenity on the cover? A moral global warming, melting away the values that the sanity of a society rests on.

Anyway, end of rant. As an author when putting part of yourself on paper don't let your readers see you naked. Cover yourself with a proverb here, a figure of speech there and some imagery, just don't write like you speak.
