### Intent

I want to write about why I want to build a raspberry pi cluster and building the cluster.

One of my new year resolutions this year is to learn more about distributed systems and infrastructure and since I learn by doing, I decided to build a Raspberry Pi cluster which I will use for experiments. However, I learnt very soon that this will be a challenge because the Pis are sold out everywhere so I have to wait a little longer.
