Vim is a powerful editor that evolves to match your needs, it can be a peashooter or a howitzer depending on what you want to use it for. This article helps you setup Vim for basic text editing and use it as a substitute for notepad. Vim is configured through a **.vimrc** which should be in your root directory, `touch ~/.vimrc` and open the file in your favourite text editor.

### Essential Settings

Add the following to your **.vimrc** file

```sh
set number
set history=500
inoremap jj <Esc> 

map <space> /

let mapleader=","
nmap <leader>w :w!<cr>
map <silent><leader><cr> :noh<cr>

filetype plugin on
filetype indent on

au BufReadPost * if line("'\"") > 1 && line("'\"") <= line("$") | exe "normal! g'\"" | endif
```

`set number` configures vim to show line numbers and `set history=500` will make vim  remember the last five hundred commands.

When in INSERT mode clicking the `Esc` key returns you to NORMAL mode and since modern keyboards have the `Esc` key in a hard to reach location for it to be convenient especially because this is a common operation. `inoremap jj <Esc>` remaps the escape function to double clicking the `j` key. This reduces the pain especially because `j` is in the home row.

`map <space> /` maps the search functionality to the space key. So when in NORMAL mode, we can start searching for a word by pressing `Space`. Vim highlights all occurrences of the matched words. When done searching you can turn off highlighting by typing  `:noh`. 

If you've written code before then you maybe familiar with the idea of namespacing and that it prevents naming conflicts. **leader** is similar to a namespace and it allows you to add custom commands to Vim without stomping on Vim's inbuilt commands. `let mapleader=","` sets the comma as the leader
We'll use it in the next setting.

Saving a file is a common operation during editing and to make it as easy as possible use the `nmap <leader>w :w!<cr>` setting to configure Vim to save the file by typing `,w` when in NORMAL mode.

Earlier I showed how you can search and mentioned that Vim will highlight matched words. I used `:noh` to disable highlighting but we can make this easier by using `map <silent><leader><cr>:noh<cr>` which tells Vim to disable highlighting by typing `,Enter`.

`filetype plugin on` enables vim to run plugins for specific file types. `filetype indent on`  tells vim to load the file's indent file.

Assuming you are  editing two files A and B. When you're done editing B and return to A, you would like your cursor position in A to be the same as it was before you moved to B. `au BufReadPost * if line("'\"") > 1 && line("'\"") <= line("$") | exe "normal! g'\"" | endif` is an automatic command that Vim runs everytime you open a new file to do just that.

### Text And Indents

```sh
set expandtab
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4

set linebreak
set tabwidth=500
set wrap 

set autoindent
set smartindent
```

`set expandtab` replaces tab characters with space characters. `set tabstop=4` controls the number of spaces that will be inserted when the tab key is clicked. It configures it to four spaces. `set shiftwidth=4` tells vim to insert four space characters for indentation.

`set linebreak` tells vim to insert a linebreak at the following characters `" ^I!@*-+;:,./?"` instead of at the last character that fits on the screen. `set tabwidth=500` controls the width of text being inserted. `set wrap` tells vim to wrap lines longer than the window's width will wrap and display continues on the next line. 

`set autoindent` configures vim to copy indent from the current line, otherwise, new lines will start at the first column. `set smartindent` tells Vim to do smart auto indenting when starting a new line.

### Moving Windows
In vim you can split you editor into multiple windows vertically with `:vsplit` or horizontally with :split. The configuration below makes it easy to move from one window to another.


```sh
map <C-j> <C-W>j
map <C-k> <C-W>k
map <C-h> <C-W>h
map <C-l> <C-W>l
```

With these settings you can move from left to right window with `CTRL + j` and right to left with `CTRL + h`. `CTRL + l` moves you down to a lower window and `CTRL + k` moves you up to an upper window.
