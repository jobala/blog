Learning about design thinking has been eye opening, it changed how I view software products and made me realize that all software is not equal. There's humane and inhumane software. Humane software caters for human need and inhumane software exploits human need. 

Naturally the two categories lead to different kind of software companies. Humane companies make humane software and the opposite is true. However, more companies tend to be in the middle.They might make humane software but the core of their business is supported by software products that exploit human need.

Khan Academy is an example of a humane software company. They cater for the human need for knowledge by democratizing knowledge and making it available to anyone with an internet connection. On the other hand, Facebook is inhumane, they exploit the human need for connection and social acceptance to drive profits and this was made evident by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

We all have a shared responsibility to make the world a better place. Enabling humane software companies is not much but it's a step in the right direction.
