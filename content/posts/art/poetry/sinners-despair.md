Oh! That stubborn sin,<br />
Against which I cannot win,<br />
Thirsting for the devil's grin,<br />
I found comfort in the bottle of gin.<br />

Not doing what I ought,<br />
A sickness that my heart caught,<br />
All the goodness that my spirit sought,<br />
My flesh has made naught.<br />

Having fought and failed,<br />
And my path to hades trailed,<br />
With my soul has the serpent sailed,<br />
And the Lord's mercy paled.<br />
