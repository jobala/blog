Reading [Insanely Simple](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insanely-Simple-Obsession-Drives-Success/dp/067092119X) was eye opening in many ways as it unveiled the secret behind Apple's success and behind the curtain was Steve Jobs who as it were, wielded simplicity like a sword slaying the dragons of complexity and fluff. This article is my reflection on his simplicity principles and how to adopt them as software engineers.

### Build Great Products

Steve was relentless in his pursuit of great products and was famous for hitting teams with a "simplicity stick" when they demoed products that didn't meet the simplicity bar. Great products look, feel and sound perfectly natural.

The mistake we make is focusing on the technology and completely disregarding the customer. The lack of empathy and respect for the customer manifests itself as hard to use, inaccessible and complex software.

We have to put the customer at the center and all technical decisions we make should be for their benefit or help us serve them better.  

### Don't Stop At The First Solution

Steve never stopped at the first solution and made sure that Apple's products had been whittled down to their essence. The first solution was a starting point for a better and simple solution. He would edit out and minimize unnecessary choices until all that was left was the product's core.

The challenge for software engineers is to push past the comfort of a working solution and find a better solution. A good opportunity to do this is to spend a little more time to improve the code's readability after having something that works.

### Focus

Focus is saying no to things that you would love to do. Apple could enter any market and disrupt it but instead it elects to work on a few things and do it well. Working on less gives Apple more time to build high quality products.

The best advise I have received is that you can't do two jobs and do them well, there's always the temptation to learn one more framework or pickup one more project. Doing more denies you the time to build high quality and simple software.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, we should aspire to build great products, the first solution is not always the best solution and focusing gives us more time to simplify and build high quality products.
