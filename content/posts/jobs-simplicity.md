Reading [Insanely Simple](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insanely-Simple-Obsession-Drives-Success/dp/067092119X) was eye opening in many ways as it unveiled the secret behind Apple's success. Behind the curtain was Steve Jobs who much like St. George slayer of dragons wielded simplicity like a sword and slayed the dragons of complexity and fluff. This article is my reflection of the principles and how to adopt them as software engineers.

### Apply Your Core Values

One of Steve's core value was building great products. He was relentless in his pursuit and was famous for hitting teams with a "simplicity stick" when they demoed products that didn't meet the simplicity bar. He had a vision of how things should work and would accept nothing less.

As software engineers we have a set of core values like ensuring that the software we release to customers is tested and documented yet we more often than not bypass these checks for the sake of speed. Forgetting that in order to go fast, we need to go well. The software we release to customers should reflect the values we hold just like the way every Apple product reflects Steve's core values.

### Don't Stop At The First Solution

Steve never stopped at the first solution and made sure that Apple's products had been whittled down to their essence. The first solution was a starting point for a better and simple solution. He would edit out and minimize unnecessary choices until all that was left was the product's core.

The challenge for software engineers is to push past the comfort of a working solution and find a better solution. A good opportunity to do this is to spend a little more time to improve the code's readability after having something that works.

### Focus

Focus is saying no to things that you would love to do. Apple could enter any market and disrupt it but instead it elects to work on a few things and do it well. Working on less gives Apple more time to build high quality products.

The best advise I have received is that you can't do two jobs and do them well, there's always the temptation to learn one more framework or pickup one more project. Doing more denies you the time to build high quality and simple software.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, our products should reflect the values we hold, the first solution is not always the best solution and focusing gives us more time to simplify and build high quality products.
