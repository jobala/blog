A system that is easy to understand, is easy to maintain and complex systems are hard to understand and therefore hard to maintain. Coupling different ideas and intents is fundamental characteristic of complex systems, the more ideas or intents a module couples the more complex it is. 

The worst thing about complexity is that it compounds and if you don't take care of it soon enough it will grow into an unmanageable mess.
