Hey, I am Japheth. Welcome to my little corner of the wild wide web.


This site serves the following purposes:
  1. To give back by sharing what I have learnt over time.
  2. Reflect on what I do, no learning happens without reflection.
  3. A creative outlet.

My interests are in:
  - Developer tools
  - Go 
  - Distributed Systems 

Other than that, I am a recovering self taught developer.
