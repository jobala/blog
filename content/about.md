Hey, I am Japheth. Welcome to my little corner of the wild wide web.

This site serves the following purposes:

1. To share what I have learnt.
2. Reflect on what I do, no learning happens without reflection.
3. A creative outlet.

I am interested in:

- Developer productivity
- Go
- Distributed Systems

Other than that, I am a recovering self taught developer.
